# Learning Nuxt & Vue.js

## Overview
This project serves as a practical learning journey to explore Nuxt.js and Vue.js while building small web applications. The project includes setting up a Nuxt app from scratch, implementing UI frameworks like Vuetify, integrating mapping libraries, and building subpages in Nuxt. This README outlines the steps taken during this process and the challenges solved along the way.

## Day 1: Initial Setup and HTML Challenge

### Description
- Set up a Nuxt project from scratch.
- Followed tutorials to get familiar with the framework and development environment.
- Created a small website using HTML:
  - Main page with two subpages.
  - Each subpage includes a link back to the main page.
  - The main page contains links to the subpages.

### Nuxt Subpages
- Converted the HTML structure into a Nuxt app with two subpages, demonstrating the use of the Nuxt file-based routing system.
